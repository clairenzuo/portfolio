          several UX projects I did <br>
          in the past. They're focused on <br>
          student budgeting and pairing <br>
          incoming students with mentors. 🌟</p>

        <p> The two projects consisted of: iBudget <br>
          Problem: Proper budgeting is a common issue for post-secondary 
          students, often their first experience managing personal finances, 
          students tend to overspend. Current budgeting apps are catered towards 
          working individuals with full-time jobs, usually complex and focused 
          on investing and credit score monitoring, it can prove to be a 
          difficult experience for students beginning their budgeting journey. <br>
          <br> 
          Solution: iBudget is an efficient and intuitive way for a college student to manage 
          their expenses and adjust future spending accordingly. It’s customizable so that 
          the user can cater the categories to their personal needs and easy to understand and 
          focused on more immediate spending.  <br> 
          <br>
        The second one being a design challenge; Integrate: <br>
        To strengthen the school community your school wants to create an 
        experience that allows older students to connect with new students to help them 
        adjust. Consider the sign up process and how mentors and mentees can connect with 
        each other through on-campus experiences.
